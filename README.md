## ⬇️ Download

Download `apk` file for ``Android`` 👉 [vocaday_app.apk](https://github.com/helkaloic/vocaday_app/releases)

Download from `Google Play Store` 👉 [Vocaday: English vocabulary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vocaday.vocaday_app)

## ⚙️ Setup

Get started with Vocaday by following these simple steps:

1. **Install FlutterFire CLI & Firebase:**

   - Install [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/)

   - Add Firebase to your Flutter app via this [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)

1. **Clean and Get Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter clean
    flutter pub get
    ```

2. **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

3. **(Optional) to build `.apk` file:**
    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```


## 🪲 Debug/Release

Generate `debug.keystore`:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore "android\app\debug.keystore" -storepass android -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias androiddebugkey -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
```

Get `SHA-1` or `SHA-256` fingerprint:

```
keytool -list -v -keystore "android\app\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

If Google Sign In did not work, try to run these commands:

```
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

Then use the `SHA-1/SHA-256` with tag **'Config: debug'** to update fingerprints on your Firebase project.

## 💻 Code Generation

- ### Easy_localization:

    If you make any changes from any translation files. To update the new changes, run those commands below in order:

1. Generate Loader class:

    ```bash
    dart run easy_localization:generate -S "assets/translations" -O "lib/app/translations"
    ```

2. Generate Keys class:
    ```bash
    dart run easy_localization:generate -S "assets/translations" -O "lib/app/translations" -o "locale_keys.g.dart" -f keys -u true
    ```

    For detailed information, refer to the [easy_localization documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization#-code-generation).

    | Arguments | Short | Default | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ------- | ----------- |

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutter_gen
    ```

1. Run build_runner:

    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

    fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml
    ```
